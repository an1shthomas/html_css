<p>In the late summer of that year we lived in a house in a village that looked across the river
and the plain to the mountains. In the bed of the river there were pebbles and boulders, dry and white in the sun, and the water was clear and swiftly moving and blue in the channels.</p>

<p>The plain was rich with crops; there were many orchards of fruit trees and beyond the plain the
mountains were brown and bare. There was fighting in the mountains and at night we could see the flashes from the artillery</p>

<p>Sometimes in the dark we heard the troops marching under the window and guns going past pulled by motortractors. There was much traffic at night and many mules on the roads with boxes of ammunitions on each side of their pack-saddles and gray motor-trucks that carried men, and other trucks with loads covered with canvas that moved slower in the traffic.</p>
